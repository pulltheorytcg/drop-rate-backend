# Drop Rate n8n provisioning

This directory makes production n8n workflows version-controlled and reproducible without exposing the n8n editor publicly.

## Rules

- Base image is pinned in `Dockerfile.n8n`.
- Workflow JSON contains no credentials or secrets.
- Startup provisioning is additive: it imports a workflow only when its stable workflow ID is absent.
- Startup must never delete/recreate the n8n SQLite database.
- Existing persistent workflows are not silently overwritten.
- Workflow publishing is a separate deliberate step after import/validation.
- Secrets remain Railway environment variables / n8n credentials, never Git.

## Why additive first

Blind re-imports can overwrite a workflow while an older execution is running or erase a manual emergency correction. V1 therefore bootstraps missing workflows only. A later deployment tool can perform explicit, version-aware updates with backup/rollback.

## Production migration gates

Before switching the existing n8n service from the stock image:

1. Build the derived image in CI.
2. Validate every workflow JSON.
3. Confirm n8n owner/project initialization supports CLI import.
4. Confirm the persistent volume is mounted at application start.
5. Take/verify a recoverable n8n database backup.
6. Deploy with the same encryption key and user-folder settings.
7. Verify health, workflow list and webhook registration.
8. Redeploy once more and prove the workflow/database persist.
9. Only then point the automation dispatcher at DR-00.

No public n8n domain is required for this provisioning model.


## DR-00 signed ingress

`DR00IngressV1` is the first version-controlled ingress workflow. It is intentionally imported **inactive**.

Runtime requirements before activation:

- `DROP_RATE_AUTOMATION_WEBHOOK_SECRET` must match the dispatcher secret and be at least 32 characters.
- The n8n Code node must be allowed to load Node's built-in `crypto` module (for example via the deployment's n8n Code-node built-in-module allowlist).
- Requests older/newer than five minutes are rejected.
- The HMAC is verified with a timing-safe comparison before the event can be acknowledged.
- Invalid signatures/envelopes receive HTTP 401; valid envelopes receive HTTP 202.

**Important:** do not activate DR-00 merely because it imports successfully. A 202 causes the dispatcher to ACK the outbox event. Activation therefore waits until the event router/handler is connected and an end-to-end test proves that accepted events are durably handled rather than swallowed.
